### About
I have created this open source blog CMS as current open source 
systems like WordPress are an overkill for the average users. 
I am using my experience as lead developer at a firm that created 
a custom very advanced CMS. Using user feedback from our clients using
the CMS, I have quite a great knowledge of what people want with a fairly
quite simple site / CMS.

Please enjoy! Any feedback is very well appreciated.

##### PS. The current stage of this repository is not yet usable for any production environment!

### What will this CMS have?
As Laravel uses blades I will create this CMS using multiple templates. With a 
little knowledge of HTML (Blade templating) and CSS these templates are easy 
to adjust to your own preference:

 - Front end blades are located in the `app\Views\templates` folder
 - The corresponding CSS, JS and image files are located in the corresponding 
  `public\assets\templates` folder
